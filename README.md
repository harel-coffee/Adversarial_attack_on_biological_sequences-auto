# Adversarial_attack_on_biological_sequences

The code to generate adversarial examples are given in Code/illumina_novaseq_.py and Code/pbsim_error_read_simulator.py files

Code for Spike2Vec is taken from the following repository
https://github.com/sarwanpasha/Spike2Vec

The code for PSSM2Vec is given in ```PSSM2Vec_vector_generation.ipynb``` notebook

The code for Min2Vec is given in ```Min2Vec_and_tSNE_logic_code.ipynb``` notebook

Our dataset is available on Google Drive
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1adtr8FImIYTqxM20wgInRqIZ8EJY4HVS?usp=sharing

To run the code, you just need to update the dataset path in the notebooks and it will compute the results.
